Perfect! Based on your answers, here's a tailored approach for an AI-assisted development process:

## Adjusted Development Strategy for AI-Assisted WearOS Development

### Pre-Development Setup (Week 1)

**Task 1: Environment Setup**
```
AI Prompt: "Create a step-by-step guide for setting up a new WearOS project in Android Studio with:
- Phone app module
- Watch app module  
- Shared module for data models
- Minimum SDK versions for Pixel Watch compatibility"
```

**Task 2: Basic Project Structure**
```
AI Prompt: "Generate the initial project structure for a WearOS app called StepBlocks with:
- Gradle files configured for phone and watch modules
- Basic manifest files
- Dependencies for Room database, Health Services API, and DataLayer API"
```

### Phase 1: Data Models & Database (Week 2-3)

Start with data because AI can generate this very reliably.

**Segment 1.1: Core Data Models**
```
AI Prompt: "Create Kotlin data classes for StepBlocks app:
- TimeBlock (name, startTime, endTime, targetSteps, notifyStart, notifyMid, notifyEnd)
- Template (id, name, timeBlocks list)
- DayAssignment (dayOfWeek, templateId)
- Use Room database annotations"
```

**Segment 1.2: Database Setup**
```
AI Prompt: "Create a Room database for StepBlocks with:
- DAOs for Template CRUD operations
- TypeConverters for Time and List<TimeBlock>
- Database singleton with pre-populated example template
- Basic unit tests for database operations"
```

### Phase 2: Phone App - Template Management (Week 4-6)

Phone app first (contrary to my earlier advice) because you need it to create templates.

**Segment 2.1: Basic Phone UI**
```
AI Prompt: "Create a simple Android activity with:
- RecyclerView showing list of templates
- Floating action button to add template
- Each item shows template name and total steps
- Use Material Design 3 components"
```

**Segment 2.2: Template Creation**
```
AI Prompt: "Create template creation screen with:
- Text input for template name
- RecyclerView for time blocks
- Add Block button that adds consecutive blocks
- Each block shows time range and step target
- Save button that validates and saves to database"
```

**Segment 2.3: Time Block Editor**
```
AI Prompt: "Create a dialog/screen for editing time blocks with:
- Time pickers for start/end time
- Number input for steps
- Three checkboxes for notifications
- Validation to prevent overlapping blocks"
```

### Phase 3: Basic Watch App (Week 7-8)

**Segment 3.1: Watch Data Layer**
```
AI Prompt: "Create WearOS data layer sync for StepBlocks:
- Send templates from phone to watch
- Store received templates in watch local storage
- Handle connection state changes
- Basic error handling"
```

**Segment 3.2: Watch UI - Now Screen**
```
AI Prompt: "Create main WearOS activity showing:
- Current time block name
- Circular progress indicator
- Step count (hardcoded for now)
- Target steps for current block
- Use Wear Compose UI"
```

### Phase 4: Step Counting Integration (Week 9-10)

**Segment 4.1: Health Services**
```
AI Prompt: "Integrate WearOS Health Services for step counting:
- Request permissions in manifest
- Create service to read daily steps
- Calculate steps within current time block
- Handle permission requests"
```

**Segment 4.2: Progress Tracking**
```
AI Prompt: "Create progress tracking logic:
- Calculate current block based on time
- Track steps per block throughout day
- Store progress in local database
- Reset at midnight"
```

### Phase 5: Notifications (Week 11-12)

**Segment 5.1: Notification Logic**
```
AI Prompt: "Create notification system for WearOS:
- Schedule notifications at block start/mid/end times
- Calculate if user is behind pace at midpoint
- Use custom vibration patterns
- Only send if notification is enabled for block"
```

### Phase 6: History & Polish (Week 13-14)

**Segment 6.1: History Storage**
```
AI Prompt: "Add history tracking:
- Save daily progress to database
- Sync history from watch to phone
- Show history in phone app calendar view
- Calculate completion percentages"
```

## AI Prompt Engineering Tips

### 1. Code Generation Strategy

**Good Prompt Structure:**
```
"Create a [specific component] for [app name] that:
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [Specific requirement 3]
Use [specific technology/library]
Include error handling and comments"
```

### 2. Iterative Refinement

**Step 1:** Generate basic code
```
"Create a basic WearOS activity that displays 'Hello World'"
```

**Step 2:** Add functionality
```
"Modify the activity to show current time and a step count variable"
```

**Step 3:** Integrate real data
```
"Update to read actual steps from Health Services API"
```

### 3. Testing Each Component

**For each major component:**
```
"Create a simple test to verify:
- [Component] correctly [does specific thing]
- Handles [edge case]
- Include manual testing instructions"
```

## Simplified Architecture for Beginners

### 1. Skip Complex Patterns
- No MVVM/MVI initially (add later)
- Direct database access from activities
- Simple callbacks instead of Flow/LiveData
- Minimal abstraction layers

### 2. File Organization
```
/phone
  MainActivity.kt           # Template list
  CreateTemplateActivity.kt # Template creation
  TemplateDatabase.kt      # Room database
  Models.kt               # Data classes

/watch  
  MainActivity.kt         # Now screen
  DataSyncService.kt     # Receive templates
  StepCounterService.kt  # Count steps
  NotificationService.kt # Send notifications

/shared
  TimeCalculations.kt    # Shared logic
```

### 3. Development Checkpoints

**After each phase, you should have:**
- Working APK you can install
- One specific feature working end-to-end
- Code you understand (ask AI to explain)
- Basic manual test to verify it works

## Week-by-Week AI Prompts

**Week 1:** 
- "Create new Android Studio project with phone and watch modules"
- "Add Room database dependencies to both modules"

**Week 2:**
- "Create Room entities for TimeBlock and Template"
- "Create DAO with insertTemplate and getAllTemplates"

**Week 3:**
- "Create MainActivity with RecyclerView for templates"
- "Add click handling to open template creation"

[Continue for each week...]

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't try to generate entire app at once** - AI works better with specific, focused requests
2. **Test after each generation** - Don't stack untested code
3. **Keep prompts simple** - Complex prompts lead to complex code
4. **Save working versions** - Use git after each working feature
