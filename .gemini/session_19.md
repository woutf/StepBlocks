# Session Log: TodayViewModel Implementation

## Goals for this Session
Implement the `TodayViewModel` to provide data for the "Today" screen, as outlined in Task 2.1 of the implementation plan.

## What Was Accomplished
- Uncommented and updated `TodayViewModel.kt`.
- Created the `TodayUiState` data class to hold the UI state.
- Updated `DayAssignmentDao.kt` with the `getDayAssignmentForDay` function.
- Updated `DailyProgressDao.kt` with `getTemplateById`, `insertDailyProgress`, `getDailyProgressByDate`, and `updateDailyProgress` functions.
- Corrected method calls and data types in `TodayViewModel.kt` to align with the DAOs and data models.
- Resolved build errors related to unresolved references and type mismatches.
- The `TodayViewModel` now successfully compiles and is ready for use.

## Blockers or Issues
- The initial build failed due to incorrect method signatures and a `LocalDate` vs. `Date` type mismatch. This was resolved by updating the DAOs and correcting the `TodayViewModel`.
- A subsequent build failed due to an incorrect database query and the use of the `Template` object instead of `TemplateWithTimeBlocks`. This was resolved by correcting the DAO and updating the `TodayViewModel`.
- A final build failure was caused by a type mismatch for `templateId` and an unresolved reference to `blockName`. These were fixed in `TodayViewModel.kt`.

## Next Steps
Proceed with Task 2.2: Create "Today" Screen UI.
