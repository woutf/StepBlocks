# Goals for this Session:
- Implement the initial **Settings Screen**.
- Integrate the **Settings Screen** into the application's navigation.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Created `G:/My Drive/Programming/StepBlocks/app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/ui/screens/SettingsScreen.kt`**: A new Composable file was created with a basic Scaffold, TopAppBar, and placeholder content for the settings.
- **Modified `G:/My Drive/Programming/StepBlocks/app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/ui/screens/TemplatesScreen.kt`**: An `IconButton` with a settings icon was added to the `TopAppBar` to allow navigation to the Settings screen.
- **Modified `G:/My Drive/Programming/StepBlocks/app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/navigation/AppNavigation.kt`**:
    - A new route `"settings"` was defined for the `SettingsScreen`.
    - A `composable` block was added for `SettingsScreen` within the `NavHost`.
    - The `TemplatesScreen` composable call was updated to include the `onNavigateToSettings` lambda, which triggers navigation to the new settings route.
- Confirmed that the navigation to the Settings screen works correctly in the emulator.

# Blockers or Issues:
- Initially, I had trouble locating the correct navigation file, assuming it was `AppNavigation.kt` without a full path, but successfully used `find_files` to locate `G:/My Drive/Programming/StepBlocks/app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/navigation/AppNavigation.kt`.

# Next Steps:
- Continue implementing the detailed UI and functionality for the Settings Screen, as outlined in Section 3.6 of `description.txt`. This will involve adding sections for "Watch Connection", "Notifications", "Data", and "About".
