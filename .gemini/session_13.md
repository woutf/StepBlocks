# Goals for this Session:
- Remove the visual timeline of blocks feature from `TimeBlocksScreen.kt`.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Modified `TimeBlocksScreen.kt`**:
    - Removed the `TimeBlockTimeline` `@Composable` function definition.
    - Removed the call to `TimeBlockTimeline` within the `TimeBlocksScreen` composable.
    - Removed all associated imports (`androidx.compose.ui.graphics.toArgb`, `androidx.compose.ui.unit.sp`) and local variables (`onSurfaceColor`, `textPx`, `primaryColor`) that were specifically added for this feature.
- Ensured the project builds successfully after the removal.

# Blockers or Issues:
- During the initial implementation of the `TimeBlockTimeline` feature, there were multiple compilation errors related to attempting to call `@Composable` functions within the non-Composable `Canvas` drawing scope, and missing imports. These issues were resolved during the implementation, but the feature was ultimately removed.

# Next Steps:
- Awaiting user's next instruction for further development, referring to the `remaining_android_app_tasks.md` file if needed.
