# Goals for this Session: Remove blank space at the top of Template and Settings screens

## What Was Accomplished:
- Identified that the blank space was due to nested `Scaffold` components causing double padding.
- Removed the `Scaffold` composable from `TemplatesScreen.kt`. The `LazyColumn` is now the root of the screen, and it directly consumes the `PaddingValues` passed to it.
- Removed the `Scaffold` composable from `SettingsScreen.kt`. The `Column` is now the root of the screen, and it directly consumes the `PaddingValues` passed to it.
- Modified `AppNavigation.kt` to:
    - Hoist the `FloatingActionButton` into the main `Scaffold`.
    - Conditionally display the FAB only when the current navigation route is for the "Templates" screen.
    - Ensure the `innerPadding` from the main `Scaffold` is passed correctly to `TemplatesScreen` and `SettingsScreen`, and that these screens apply it once.
- Successfully compiled the project after these changes.

## Blockers or Issues:
- Repeatedly struggled with correctly identifying and applying file paths.
- Introduced syntax errors (e.g., stray characters, incorrect handling of multiline strings) in `TemplatesScreen.kt` and `SettingsScreen.kt` during modifications, which led to build failures.
- Had difficulty correctly diagnosing and resolving the `Scaffold` nesting and padding issues, requiring multiple iterations.

## Next Steps:
- Awaiting user's next instruction.
