# Goals for this Session:
- Populate the **Settings Screen** with its initial UI elements and structure.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Modified `G:/My Drive/Programming/StepBlocks/app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/ui/screens/SettingsScreen.kt`**:
    - Added `Text` components for section titles ("Watch Connection", "Notifications", "Data", "About").
    - Included placeholder `Text` for status and descriptive information.
    - Integrated `OutlinedButton` for "Sync Now".
    - Added `Switch` for the "Master notification toggle".
    - Incorporated `Button` components for "Export History" and "Clear All Data" with appropriate styling.
    - Added `Divider` components to separate sections.
    - Ensured correct import placement.
- Successfully built the project after the UI changes.
- Confirmed that the Settings screen UI renders correctly in the emulator.

# Blockers or Issues:
- I initially failed to run the `gradle_build` tool after making UI changes, which led to a missed compilation error related to a misplaced import statement. This was corrected by moving the `ButtonDefaults` import to the top of the file.

# Next Steps:
- Implement the view model and logic for the Settings Screen to handle user interactions and manage settings states (e.g., notification toggles, data export/clear actions, and watch connection status).
- Further refine the UI elements, such as adding specific vibration pattern selectors.
