## Goals for this Session
- Debug and fix a persistent UI bug in the "Edit Time Block" screen where the time picker dialog would fail to reopen.

## What Was Accomplished
- Diagnosed that the root cause of the bug was incorrect state management of the legacy `TimePickerDialog`.
- Refactored the `AddEditTimeBlockScreen` to use the modern Material 3 `TimePickerDialog` and `TimePicker` composables with a robust state-handling pattern.
- Resolved a file naming conflict that arose during debugging (`AddEditTimeBlockScreen.kt` vs. `AddEditTimeBlockScreenWithPicker.kt`) by consolidating the code into a single, correctly named file.
- Updated the navigation graph in `MainActivity.kt` to reflect the corrected screen file.
- Confirmed the bug is fully resolved, and the time picker now functions correctly after all dismissal actions (OK, Cancel, and dismiss-on-tap-outside).
- Established a new workflow for building, testing, and committing changes.

## Blockers or Issues
- A significant amount of time was lost due to a critical error where I was editing a file that was not actually being used by the application. This created the false impression of a severe caching or build environment problem, leading us down a lengthy and incorrect troubleshooting path.

## Next Steps
- Continue development of the "Create/Edit Template" screen.
- Connect the UI to the database to allow users to create, edit, and delete templates.
- Display the assigned days on the `TemplateCard`.
