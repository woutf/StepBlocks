## Goals for this Session
- Implement the notification toggles on the "Add/Edit Time Block" screen as specified in the product requirements.

## What Was Accomplished
- Confirmed that the `TimeBlock` data class correctly contained the `notifyStart`, `notifyMid`, and `notifyEnd` boolean fields.
- Updated the `AddEditTimeBlockViewModel` to load and manage the state of these three notification toggles.
- Modified the `AddEditTimeBlockScreen` UI to include a "Notifications" section header and three `Switch` composables, binding them to the ViewModel state.
- Ensured that the user's toggle choices are correctly persisted to the database when the time block is saved.
- Built and verified the feature, which is now working as expected.

## Blockers or Issues
- None.

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of the "Assign to Days" feature on the Template Detail screen (`TimeBlocksScreen`), which corresponds to the "date picking" functionality mentioned by the user.
