# Goals for this Session:
- Make the "Target Steps" field required when creating or editing a Time Block.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Modified `AddEditTimeBlockViewModel.kt`**:
    - Added `MutableStateFlow` for `targetStepsError` to hold validation error messages.
    - Updated `onTargetStepsChange` to validate the input for emptiness, numeric format, and positivity, setting `targetStepsError` accordingly.
    - Modified `saveTimeBlock` to prevent saving if `targetStepsError` is not null.
- **Modified `AddEditTimeBlockScreen.kt`**:
    - Updated the "Target Steps" `OutlinedTextField` to use `isError` and `supportingText` based on `uiState.targetStepsError`.
    - Modified the "Save" button's `enabled` state to depend on `uiState.targetStepsError` being null, in addition to the name being non-blank.

# Blockers or Issues:

# Next Steps:
