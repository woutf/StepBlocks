# Goals for this Session:
- Implement validation to prevent new or edited time blocks from overlapping with existing ones.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Modified `AddEditTimeBlockViewModel.kt`**:
    - Introduced `existingTimeBlocks` as a `StateFlow` to collect all time blocks for the current template.
    - Added `overlapError` as a `MutableStateFlow` to manage overlap validation error messages.
    - Implemented a `checkOverlap` private function to determine if a new time range overlaps with existing time blocks, excluding the current one if in edit mode.
    - Refactored the `init` block to use `combine` with `_uiState` and `existingTimeBlocks` to reactively validate time ranges and overlaps, updating `timeRangeError` and `overlapError` in `_uiState`.
    - Updated `saveTimeBlock` to include `overlapError` in the overall validation check before allowing a save operation.
- **Modified `AddEditTimeBlockScreen.kt`**:
    - Displayed `uiState.overlapError` as `supportingText` for the time input fields.
    - Modified the "Done" button's `enabled` state to also be `false` if `uiState.overlapError` is not null.

# Blockers or Issues:
- Encountered initial difficulties with correctly structuring the `combine` and `onEach` flow operators for reactive validation within `AddEditTimeBlockViewModel.kt`. This was resolved by separating concerns: letting `onStartTimeChange` and `onEndTimeChange` only update the respective time strings, and having a dedicated `combine` block listen to changes in times and existing blocks to calculate and then apply validation errors via `onEach`.

# Next Steps:
- Awaiting user's next instruction for further development.
