# Goals for this Session:
- Implement "at least one time block" validation for templates.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Reverted `AddEditTemplateViewModel.kt`**: Ensured it remains focused on template name editing, as time blocks are managed on a separate screen.
- **Modified `TimeBlocksViewModel.kt`**: 
    - Refactored constructor to correctly accept `TemplateRepository` and `SavedStateHandle`.
    - Extracted `templateId` from `SavedStateHandle` within the `init` block.
    - Introduced `_showNoTimeBlocksError: MutableStateFlow<Boolean>` to manage the error state.
    - Implemented a `combine` flow that observes `timeBlocks` and `templateWithTimeBlocks` to set `_showNoTimeBlocksError` to `true` if a template exists but has no associated time blocks.
    - Added implementations for `assignedDays`, `editableTemplateName`, `toggleDayAssignment`, and `updateTemplateName` properties/functions, which are essential for `TimeBlocksScreen` functionality.
- **Modified `TimeBlocksViewModelFactory.kt`**: Adjusted to correctly receive `SavedStateHandle` and pass it to the `TimeBlocksViewModel` constructor.
- **Modified `AppNavigation.kt`**: Updated to ensure `backStackEntry.savedStateHandle` is correctly passed to the `TimeBlocksViewModelFactory` when navigating to `TimeBlocksScreen`.
- **Modified `TimeBlocksScreen.kt`**: Updated to observe the `showNoTimeBlocksError` state from the ViewModel and display a warning message on the UI if the template has no time blocks.

# Blockers or Issues:
- **Architectural Mismatch**: Initial attempt to implement the "at least one time block" validation in `AddEditTemplateViewModel` proved problematic due to the existing application flow where time blocks are associated with a template ID that is generated *after* the template's initial save. This led to a decision to implement the validation on the `TimeBlocksScreen` instead.
- **ViewModel Injection Chain Errors**: Encountered multiple build failures related to correctly passing `templateId` and `SavedStateHandle` through `AppNavigation`, `TimeBlocksViewModelFactory`, and `TimeBlocksViewModel`. This required several iterative corrections to ensure proper dependency injection and state management.

# Next Steps:
- Refer to `remaining_android_app_tasks.md` for the next feature in the development plan.
