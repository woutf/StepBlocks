# Goals for this Session:
- Implement auto-prefill for new time blocks based on existing blocks or default values.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Modified `AddEditTimeBlockViewModel.kt`**:
    - Added logic within the `init` block to check if a new time block is being created (`timeBlockId` is null).
    - If it's a new time block, it now fetches the current list of time blocks for the template using `repository.getTimeBlocksForTemplate(templateId).first()`.
    - Implemented a new private function `calculateAndApplyPrefill(existingBlocks: List<TimeBlock>)` to determine the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `targetSteps` for the new block.
        - If no existing blocks, `startTime` defaults to 06:00, `endTime` to 09:00, and `targetSteps` to "2000".
        - If existing blocks are present, `startTime` is set to the `endTime` of the last block, `endTime` is 3 hours after `newStartTime` (capped at 23:59), and `targetSteps` is the average of existing blocks' `targetSteps`.
    - Updated `_uiState` with these pre-filled values.

# Blockers or Issues:
- Initially, there was a build error because `newEndTime` was declared as an immutable `val` when it needed to be a mutable `var` to allow for the 23:59 capping logic. This was corrected by changing its declaration to `var`.

# Next Steps:
- Awaiting user's next instruction for further development, referring to the `remaining_android_app_tasks.md` file if needed.
