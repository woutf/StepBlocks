# Session 17

**Goals for this Session:** Remove time block specific notification toggles and ensure global settings handle notifications.

**What Was Accomplished:**
*   Removed `notifyStart`, `notifyMid`, and `notifyEnd` toggles from `app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/ui/screens/AddEditTimeBlockScreen.kt`.
*   Updated `app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/viewmodel/AddEditTimeBlockViewModel.kt` to remove corresponding state and logic.
*   Modified `app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/data/TimeBlock.kt` data class to remove `notifyStart`, `notifyMid`, and `notifyEnd` properties.
*   Incremented the Room database version in `app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/data/AppDatabase.kt` from `3` to `4` due to schema changes.
*   Updated constructor calls for `TimeBlock` in `app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/ui/screens/TemplatesScreen.kt`, `app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/ui/components/TimeBlockCard.kt`, and `app/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/ui/screens/TimeBlocksScreen.kt` to reflect the removed notification properties.

**Blockers or Issues:**
*   Repeatedly forgetting to increment the Room database version after schema changes, leading to `IllegalStateException` for data integrity. Resolved by consistently incrementing the version in `AppDatabase.kt`.
*   Incorrect constructor calls for `TimeBlock` in various UI and ViewModel files after removing notification properties, leading to compilation errors. Resolved by systematically updating all affected files.

**Next Steps:** Awaiting user's next instruction.
