# Goals for this Session:
- Implement validation to ensure the end time of a time block is after its start time.

# What Was Accomplished:
- **Modified `AddEditTimeBlockViewModel.kt`**:
    - Introduced `timeRangeError` as a `MutableStateFlow` to manage time validation error messages.
    - Added logic within `onStartTimeChange` and `onEndTimeChange` to compare the start and end times, setting `timeRangeError` if the end time is not after the start time.
    - Updated `saveTimeBlock` to include `timeRangeError` in the overall validation check before allowing a save operation.
- **Modified `AddEditTimeBlockScreen.kt`**:
    - Displayed `uiState.timeRangeError` as `supportingText` for the time input fields.
    - Modified the "Done" button's `enabled` state to be `false` if `uiState.timeRangeError` is not null.

# Blockers or Issues:
