## Goals for this Session
Removed the "Assign to days" element and its toggles from the time block editor, as requested by the user.

- Read the content of `TimeBlocksScreen.kt`.
- Modified `TimeBlocksScreen.kt` to remove the entire section related to "Assign to days" and its associated toggles.
- Successfully built the project after making the changes.
- Waited for user confirmation that the changes work in the emulator.
- Generated a commit message following Conventional Commits specification.

## Blockers or Issues
