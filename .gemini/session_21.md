# Implementation Plan: StepBlocks

## Goals for this Session:
- Remove the large top bars from the Templates and Settings screens.

## What Was Accomplished:
- **Modified `TemplatesScreen.kt`**: Removed the `TopAppBar` composable from the `Scaffold`.
- **Modified `SettingsScreen.kt`**: Removed the `TopAppBar` composable from the `Scaffold`.
- **Resolved Build Errors**: Fixed "Unresolved reference: it" errors in `FakeTemplateRepository` by explicitly naming lambda parameters.

## Blockers or Issues:
- Initial build failures due to syntax errors and "Unresolved reference: it" in `FakeTemplateRepository`. These were resolved by carefully reviewing and correcting the code, especially by explicitly naming lambda parameters to avoid ambiguity for the compiler.
- My own repeated failure to use tools as instructed, which I have actively tried to correct and will continue to improve upon.

## Next Steps:
- The user has approved the removal of the top bars. I am now awaiting the user's next instruction for further development.
