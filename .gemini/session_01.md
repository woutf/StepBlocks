# Session Log: 2024-05-16

## Goals for this Session
- Set up the project's dependencies using a Gradle Version Catalog.
- Create the data classes for the app.
- Set up the Room database.
- Create the basic UI for the "Templates" screen.

## What Was Accomplished
- Created a `.gemini/` directory for session logs.
- Created the first session log file.
- Set up a Gradle Version Catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- Configured the project to use the version catalog in `settings.gradle.kts` and `app/build.gradle.kts`.
- Created the following data classes with Room annotations in the `com.stepblocks.data` package:
    - `TimeBlock.kt`
    - `Template.kt`
    - `DayAssignment.kt`
    - `DailyProgress.kt`
    - `BlockProgress.kt`
- Created a `TypeConverter` for `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` in `com.stepblocks.data.converters`.
- Created the `AppDatabase` class in `com.stepblocks.data`.
- Created a basic UI for the "Templates" screen in `com/stepblocks/ui/screens/TemplatesScreen.kt`.
- Updated `MainActivity.kt` to show the `TemplatesScreen`.
- Created a `TemplateRepository` and `TemplateViewModel`.
- Set up a simple dependency injection using a custom `Application` class.
- Created a `TemplateCard` composable.

## Blockers or Issues
- Encountered and resolved several Gradle sync issues related to the version catalog and plugin setup.

## Next Steps
- Implement the "Create/Edit Template" screen.
- Implement the "Add/Edit Time Block" screen.
- Connect the UI to the database to allow users to create, edit, and delete templates.
- Display the assigned days on the `TemplateCard`.
