## Goals for this Session
- Display the total daily step count for each template on the main `TemplatesScreen`.

## What Was Accomplished
- Updated the `TemplateDao` and `TemplateRepository` to expose a `Flow<List<TemplateWithTimeBlocks>>`.
- Updated the `TemplateViewModel` to consume the new repository method.
- Modified the `TemplatesScreen` to calculate the total steps for each template from the associated time blocks.
- Updated the `TemplateCard` composable to accept and display the calculated `totalSteps`, making the screen more informative at a glance.
- Verified the feature works as expected.

## Blockers or Issues
- None.

## Next Steps
