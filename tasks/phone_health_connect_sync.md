# Task: Health Connect Synchronization

**Requirement:** FR2.3 - The app is responsible for writing all step data to Health Connect.
*   All records written to Health Connect **must** include a stable, unique `clientRecordId` (e.g., `stepblocks-steps-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM`) to prevent data duplication.
*   The record's metadata must correctly identify the data source as the watch.

---

## Work Done

* Completed: The `syncStepsToHealthConnect` function in `HealthConnectRepository.kt` already correctly sets the `clientRecordId` and includes the device metadata, fulfilling these requirements.
