# Task: Initial Baseline Sync

**Requirement:** FR2.4 - Initial Baseline Sync:
*   On the first connection, the phone app must query Health Connect to find the last known sync time from all trusted sources.
*   The phone must then request a batch sync from the watch for all data recorded after this `lastKnownTime` to prevent double-counting.
