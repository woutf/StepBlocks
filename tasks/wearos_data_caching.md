# Task: Local Data Caching

**Requirement:** FR1.3 - The app must cache incremental step deltas locally using a Room database.
*   A `Worker` will save the current unsynced step count to the database every 15 minutes.
*   Cached data must be marked as "synced" after successful transmission to the phone.

---

## Work Done

**Room Database Setup:**
*   Created `CachedStepEntity.kt` in `stepblockswear/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/wear/data/` to define the schema for cached step deltas.
*   Created `StepDao.kt` in `stepblockswear/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/wear/data/` with methods for inserting, querying unsynced data, marking as synced, and pruning old data.
*   Created `AppDatabase.kt` in `stepblockswear/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/wear/data/` to define the Room database.

**WorkManager Integration:**
*   Created `WearApplication.kt` in `stepblockswear/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/wear/` to initialize WorkManager with a custom `AppWorkerFactory`.
*   Created `StepCacheWorker.kt` in `stepblockswear/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/wear/workers/` for caching unsynced step counts.
*   Created `StepPruningWorker.kt` in `stepblockswear/src/main/java/com/stepblocks/wear/workers/` for periodically pruning old data.
*   Registered `WearApplication` in `stepblockswear/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` by adding `android:name=".WearApplication"` to the `<application>` tag.
*   Added WorkManager dependencies (`androidx-work-runtime-ktx` and `androidx-work-runtime`) to `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and `stepblockswear/build.gradle.kts`.

**Build Stability:**
*   Resolved various build errors encountered during the setup, including `Unresolved reference` errors, type mismatches, and `IncompatibleComposeRuntimeVersionException`, by:
    *   Correcting Health Services `DataType` to `STEPS_DAILY`.
    *   Explicitly typing `PassiveListenerCallback`.
    *   Ensuring correct imports for WorkManager and Health Services components.
    *   Adding `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions` to `stepblockswear/build.gradle.kts`.
    *   Removing inline comments from `build.gradle.kts` that caused parsing errors.

All components are now in place and the project builds successfully.
